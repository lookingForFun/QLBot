QLBot
=========

## Introduction
QLBot is an advanced multihack for [Quake Live](http://www.quakelive.com/). It contains several features such as:

  - Aimbot
  - Autofire
  - Target Prediction
  - Wallhack
  - Glowshells/Chams

And much, much more...

##How do I use this
There will be no detailed installation instructions. Suffice to say that the code compiles with Visual Studio 2010 or later and targets Windows 7. To inject, make sure that the Quake Live plugin has loaded and inject before starting your first game. You can automate this if you're even remotely familiar with the Windows API.

The code is strictly for 32-bit processes, thus regardless of where you run this, QL should be hosted in a 32-bit browser.

##Other notes
* The source code is not neat - I know that well, and I'll consider pull requests that improve it. Keep in mind that some of the code is almost 10 years old.
* There is no documentation - I know that too, that's on purpose. If anyone contributes a high quality manual, I'll consider that.

## Support
This code is **not** supported! Feel free to report issues, but they're much more likely to be fixed if you fix them yourself and send a pull request than otherwise.
